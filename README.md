# A2Z DSA Challenge: My Journey to Mastery ðŸš€

## Overview

Welcome to my repository for the **A2Z DSA Challenge**! This project is my personal commitment to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using the highly-regarded [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2).

My goal is clear: to build a rock-solid foundation in problem-solving and crack the technical interviews at top-tier product-based companies. This repository will serve as a living journal of my progress, dedication, and the daily grind required to turn this ambition into reality.

## The Mission

The rules are simple but demand consistency:
- **Solve a minimum of 4 problems every day.**
- **Push the solutions to this repository regularly.**
- **Deeply understand the concepts**, not just rush to a solution.

This is more than just a coding streak; it's a structured plan to elevate my skills from the ground up.

## My Grind: The Timeline

I have created a strict schedule to cover all the essential topics systematically. Here is the plan I will be following from today, **October 30, 2025**.

## Repository Structure

To maintain clarity and make navigation easy, the solutions will be organized into folders corresponding to each step of the DSA sheet.
